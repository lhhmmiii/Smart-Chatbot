# üìù Smart-Document-Summarization-and-QA-Assistantt

This repository contains a chatbot application developed using [Chainlit](https://www.chainlit.io/) and various AI-powered services. This chatbot can respond to generate and edit photos, can summarize text from users, and can answer document-related questions.

**Currently having a little problem because langchain's tools are only in beta.**

## ‚ú® Features

- **Summarize Content** Upload PDF, Word, or text files, and the chatbot will summarize the content. (The chatbot is optimized for handling documents and content in Vietnamese.)
- **Document QA:** The task of answering questions based on the content of a document using AI to understand and extract relevant information.
- **Generative and edit image:** The process of creating or modifying images using AI based on user-provided descriptions or instructions.
- **Question Answering:** Use current knowledge of the LLM(Gemini-1.5-flash) to answer the input from user.
- **Search:** A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. **(processing)**
